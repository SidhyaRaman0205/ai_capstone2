# Predicting Customer Churn for Telecommunication Companies

## The business problem I have been examining is addressing customer churn in telecommunication companies. I have used a data set from Kaggle that has information regarding this subject. The models I have used to help solve this problem are Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. These models output a percentage that will determine the accuracy of the model in predicting customer churn. The models were able to return an accuracy rate of 92 and 95% respectively.
